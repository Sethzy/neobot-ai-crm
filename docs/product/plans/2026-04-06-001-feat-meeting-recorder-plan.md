# feat: Meeting Recorder — Browser-Native Recording with Agent Post-Processing

## Overview

Add a meeting recorder to Sunder's web app. User clicks Record in the chat thread, the thread area becomes a notepad for jotting notes while mic captures audio, and when they stop the agent transcribes the recording, suggests a CRM link, posts a merged summary, and offers a checklist of follow-up actions. No extension, no desktop app, no install — pure browser APIs.

This is the feature that makes Sunder indispensable for advisory sales professionals. Every meeting compounds the agent's memory. Every call makes the CRM more accurate without the user touching it.

## Problem Statement

Advisory sales users are on calls all day. After each call they manually update CRM records, create follow-up tasks, and draft emails. This is tedious, error-prone, and the first thing dropped when busy. Meeting context gets lost.

Users can already paste transcripts into chat and the agent processes them. But that requires recording separately, then copy-pasting. The gap is a zero-friction way to record directly in Sunder so the agent pipeline fires automatically. (see origin: `docs/product/ideations/2026-04-06-meeting-recorder-requirements.md`)

## Proposed Solution

Mic-only recording via `getUserMedia` — matching Notion's browser behavior. Recording controls and a notepad replace the chat thread during recording. After stop, audio uploads to Supabase Storage, gets transcribed by Groq Whisper Turbo ($0.04/hr, 228x realtime), and an agent run processes the transcript + user notes to suggest CRM links and follow-up actions.

**Key decisions carried forward from origin:**
- Mic-only for v1 (no getDisplayMedia tab capture — UX too unfamiliar)
- Groq Whisper Turbo batch transcription (near-free, insanely fast)
- Agent suggests CRM link, user confirms (never auto-links)
- Summary + suggested actions checklist (not auto-execute)
- Notepad during recording (user notes merged with transcript, treated as authoritative)
- Mobile = "Best for in-person conversations" (same positioning as Notion)
- Desktop app path = white-label Meetily later if needed, not build from scratch

## Technical Approach

### Why This Architecture

- **Presigned URL upload** — Vercel functions have a ~4.5MB body limit. Audio files are 10-40MB. Upload directly to Supabase Storage via presigned URL, then notify the API with just the metadata. This follows the pattern used by `app/api/crm/attachments/upload/route.ts`. (see origin for file size estimates: ~14MB/30min, ~29MB/60min)
- **Groq in the API route** — Groq is so fast (228x realtime) that a 60-min file transcribes in ~15 seconds. This fits within Vercel's 300s timeout. No need for async/polling/webhooks.
- **Agent run, not custom pipeline** — The post-meeting processing is just an agent run with meeting-specific instructions injected. Reuses existing runner, tools, approval gate, and chat UI. No new infrastructure.
- **No new trigger type** — Instead of a custom `meeting_transcribed` trigger, we fire a regular chat-type agent run with the transcript + notes as the user message. The agent's instructions tell it what to do. Simpler than building a new trigger mechanism.

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Upload + Transcription Pipeline (Backend)

Build the server-side pipeline first so it can be tested independently.

**1a. Presigned upload endpoint**

New API route: `app/api/meetings/upload-url/route.ts`
- Accepts: `{ filename, contentType, durationSeconds }`
- Validates: auth, content type is audio (webm/mp4/ogg/mpeg/wav)
- Generates presigned upload URL to `{clientId}/meetings/raw/{uuid}.{ext}`
- Returns: `{ uploadUrl, storagePath }`
- Pattern: follow `app/api/files/upload/route.ts` auth + validation pattern

**1b. Ingest endpoint**

New API route: `app/api/meetings/ingest/route.ts`
- Accepts: `{ storagePath, durationSeconds, notes, threadId }`
- Validates: auth, storagePath exists in storage
- Downloads audio from Supabase Storage
- Sends to Groq Whisper API (`whisper-large-v3-turbo`)
- Saves transcript markdown to `{clientId}/meetings/{date}-{slug}.md`
- Inserts `meeting_records` row
- Creates a user message in the thread containing transcript + notes
- Fires agent run on the thread via existing `runAgent()` (with meeting-specific instructions)
- Returns: `{ success, meetingRecordId, transcriptPath }`

**1c. Database: meeting_records table**

```sql
create table meeting_records (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  client_id uuid not null references clients(id),
  thread_id uuid not null,
  audio_path text not null,
  transcript_path text,
  duration_seconds integer,
  notes text,
  linked_person_id uuid references crm_people(id),
  linked_company_id uuid references crm_companies(id),
  linked_deal_id uuid references crm_deals(id),
  status text not null default 'processing',
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

-- RLS: tenant isolation
alter table meeting_records enable row level security;
create policy "Users can manage own meeting records"
  on meeting_records for all
  using (client_id = (select active_client_id()));
```

Status enum: `processing` → `transcribed` → `linked` → `complete`

**1d. Groq Whisper integration**

New utility: `src/lib/transcription/groq-whisper.ts`
- Wraps Groq's audio transcription API
- Input: audio `Buffer` + content type
- Output: `{ text: string, segments?: Array<{ start, end, text }> }`
- Handles error cases: file too large, unsupported format, rate limit
- Fallback: AssemblyAI batch API if Groq fails (noted in origin doc)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Presigned URL endpoint generates valid upload URLs for audio MIME types
- [ ] Audio file uploads to Supabase Storage via presigned URL
- [ ] Ingest endpoint downloads audio, transcribes via Groq, saves transcript
- [ ] meeting_records row created with correct status lifecycle
- [ ] Agent run fires after transcription with transcript + notes in context
- [ ] End-to-end: upload audio file → transcript appears in thread within 2 minutes

#### Phase 2: Recording UI (Client-Side)

Build the browser recording experience.

**2a. Audio recorder hook**

New hook: `src/hooks/use-audio-recorder.ts`
- Manages `getUserMedia` → `MediaRecorder` lifecycle
- States: `idle` | `recording` | `paused` | `uploading`
- Handles:
  - MIME type detection via `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported()` (prefer `audio/webm;codecs=opus`, fall back to `audio/mp4`)
  - Start/pause/resume/stop controls
  - Accumulate chunks in memory via `ondataavailable`
  - Combine chunks into single Blob on stop
  - Upload flow: get presigned URL → PUT blob → POST ingest metadata
  - Elapsed time tracking
  - Waveform data via `AnalyserNode` for visual feedback
- Returns: `{ state, elapsedSeconds, waveformData, start, pause, resume, stop, error }`

**2b. Recording bar component**

New component: `src/components/chat/recording-bar.tsx`
- Renders at top of thread area during recording
- Shows: red dot, elapsed timer (`MM:SS`), live waveform visualization, pause button, stop button
- Waveform: simple canvas or SVG bar visualization from `AnalyserNode` frequency data
- Pause toggles to resume icon
- Stop triggers upload flow

**2c. Meeting notepad component**

New component: `src/components/chat/meeting-notepad.tsx`
- Plain `<textarea>` that replaces the message list during recording
- Placeholder: "Type notes during your meeting..."
- Auto-grows with content
- Enter = new line (NOT submit)
- Notes stored in local React state
- On stop: notes text passed to upload flow

**2d. Chat panel integration**

Modify: `src/components/chat/chat-panel.tsx`
- Add 🎙 button to chat composer (next to 📎 attach button)
- When `isRecording`:
  - Hide message list
  - Show `<RecordingBar />` pinned to top
  - Show `<MeetingNotepad />` in the thread area
  - Hide normal input bar
- When recording stops:
  - Restore message list
  - Show upload progress as inline system message
  - Restore normal input bar

**2e. Upload progress component**

New component: `src/components/chat/upload-progress.tsx`
- Inline card in the thread showing: upload progress bar, "Uploading recording... X%", "Transcribing...", "✓ Uploaded · Transcribing... 45 min recording · 3 notes"
- Transitions through states: uploading → transcribing → done (agent takes over)

**2f. Mobile adaptations**

- Same components, responsive layout
- On mobile browsers: show note at bottom of notepad: "Best for in-person conversations (AI only hears your microphone)"
- Detect mobile via viewport width or user agent

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] 🎙 button visible in chat composer on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Clicking Record starts mic capture, thread transforms to notepad + recording bar
- [ ] Waveform visualization provides visual feedback that mic is active
- [ ] Pause/resume works correctly
- [ ] User can type notes in the notepad during recording
- [ ] Stop combines audio chunks, uploads via presigned URL, shows progress
- [ ] Thread restores to normal chat after upload completes
- [ ] Mobile shows "in-person conversations" note
- [ ] Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox (desktop), Safari + Chrome (mobile)

#### Phase 3: Agent Post-Processing (Prompt Engineering + CRM Flow)

Wire the agent to process meeting transcripts intelligently.

**3a. Meeting-specific agent instructions**

New file: `src/lib/ai/meeting-prompt.ts`
- Exported function that generates meeting-specific instructions
- Injected into the agent run when processing a meeting
- Instructions cover:
  1. Read the transcript and user notes (notes are authoritative — override transcript)
  2. Search CRM for people/companies/deals mentioned
  3. Use `ask_user_question` to confirm: "This sounds like a call with [Name] — [Deal]. Link to their record? [Confirm / Change]"
  4. If no match: ask who it was. Offer to create new contact or save unlinked.
  5. Write meeting summary to `memory/meetings/{date}-{name}.md` via `write_file`
  6. Present suggested actions as a checklist (create tasks, update deal, draft follow-up)
  7. Execute only the actions the user selects

**3b. CRM link confirmation flow**

Uses existing `ask_user_question` tool pattern (`src/lib/runner/tools/utility/ask-user-question.ts`).
- Agent searches CRM, finds best match
- Presents single-select: "Link to [Person]'s record? [Confirm / Change / Save unlinked]"
- On "Change": agent asks who, searches again
- On "Save unlinked": saves to `{clientId}/meetings/unlinked/{date}.md`
- On confirm: updates `meeting_records.linked_person_id` and saves transcript under person's memory path

**3c. Summary + suggested actions**

Agent generates a structured response:
- Meeting summary (bullet points, merged from transcript + notes, notes marked with ← note)
- Suggested actions as a checklist with pre-checked defaults:
  - Create task (from action items found in transcript/notes)
  - Update deal stage (if stage change discussed)
  - Draft follow-up email (if follow-up warranted)
  - Note personal details (rapport builders)

The checklist could use the existing `ask_user_question` tool with `multi_select` type, or be rendered as a json-render spec with interactive checkboxes.

**Decision for planning:** Use `ask_user_question` with `multi_select` for v1. It's already built, renders checkboxes, and returns user selections. The agent then executes only the selected actions using existing CRM tools.

**3d. Follow-up email draft**

Agent drafts the email using transcript context + CRM data. Presents it inline in the chat. Uses existing approval pattern:
- Agent posts the draft as a text message
- Follows with `ask_user_question`: "Approve this follow-up? [Approve & Send / Edit / Discard]"
- On "Approve & Send": agent sends via existing email/messaging tools (or queues for approval if external-facing)
- On "Edit": user types edits, agent revises
- On "Discard": agent acknowledges, moves on

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Agent correctly reads transcript + notes, with notes taking priority
- [ ] Agent searches CRM and suggests correct person/company/deal match
- [ ] User can confirm, change, or save unlinked via ask_user_question
- [ ] Meeting summary is written to person's memory path
- [ ] Suggested actions appear as selectable checklist
- [ ] Agent executes only user-selected actions
- [ ] Follow-up email draft uses transcript context and relationship details
- [ ] End-to-end: record → stop → link → summary → select actions → done in <2 minutes

## System-Wide Impact

### Interaction Graph

1. User clicks Record → `getUserMedia` permission prompt (first time only)
2. Recording stop → presigned URL fetch → PUT to Supabase Storage → POST to `/api/meetings/ingest`
3. Ingest route → Groq Whisper API → save transcript → insert meeting_records → create user message → `runAgent()`
4. Agent run → `crm_search` → `ask_user_question` (CRM link) → `write_file` (summary) → `ask_user_question` (suggested actions) → CRM tools (create tasks, update deal) → `ask_user_question` (approve follow-up)

### Error Propagation

- **Mic permission denied** → show error in UI, don't start recording
- **MediaRecorder not supported** → show "Recording not supported in this browser"
- **Upload fails** → retry button in upload progress card (audio still in memory)
- **Groq API fails** → fall back to AssemblyAI batch, or show error + retry
- **Groq rate limit** → queue and retry with backoff, or fall back
- **Agent run fails** → transcript is still saved; user can trigger reprocessing manually

### State Lifecycle Risks

- **Partial upload** → presigned URL expires (1 hour). If upload stalls, user retries.
- **Tab closed during recording** → audio lost (no IndexedDB in v1). Acceptable for v1 — add crash recovery later.
- **Transcription succeeds but agent run fails** → `meeting_records.status` stays at `transcribed`. Transcript is safe. Agent can be re-triggered.
- **Agent links to wrong person** → user corrects via "Change" flow. meeting_records.linked_person_id updated.

### Integration Test Scenarios

1. Record 5-minute audio → upload → transcribe → agent suggests correct CRM match → user confirms → summary saved to correct person's memory
2. Record on mobile Safari → upload WebM/MP4 → Groq accepts format → transcript generated
3. Record with notes typed → notes appear in merged summary, overriding transcript where contradicting
4. No CRM match → agent asks who → user provides name → agent creates contact → links transcript
5. Groq API down → fallback to AssemblyAI → transcript still generated (degraded latency)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements (from origin R1-R9)

- [ ] R1: User can start/stop mic recording from a button in the chat composer
- [ ] R2: Recording bar shows red dot, timer, waveform, pause, stop — replaces input area
- [ ] R3: Audio uploads on stop with progress indicator in thread
- [ ] R4: Groq Whisper transcribes audio; transcript saved to Supabase Storage
- [ ] R5: Agent suggests CRM link; user confirms/changes/saves unlinked
- [ ] R6: Agent posts summary + suggested action checklist; executes user selections
- [ ] R7: Mobile works mic-only with "Best for in-person conversations" note
- [ ] R8: Transcript saved to linked person's memory path
- [ ] R9: Notepad replaces thread during recording; notes merged into summary

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] End-to-end flow completes in under 2 minutes for 60-minute recording
- [ ] Transcription cost under $0.10 per hour of audio
- [ ] Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox (desktop) and Safari, Chrome (mobile)
- [ ] Audio files under 50MB upload reliably

### Quality Gates

- [ ] Unit tests for `use-audio-recorder` hook (mock MediaRecorder)
- [ ] Unit tests for Groq Whisper integration (mock API responses)
- [ ] Integration test for upload → transcribe → agent run pipeline
- [ ] Manual QA on Chrome, Safari mobile, Firefox

## Success Metrics

- Users record meetings directly in Sunder (vs. paste transcript)
- Time from meeting end to CRM updated: <2 minutes
- Transcription accuracy acceptable without diarization
- Cost per user: <$10/mo at heavy usage (4 hrs/day)

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

- **Groq API key** — needs to be provisioned and added to environment
- **Supabase Storage** — `agent-files` bucket already exists; meetings path just needs to be allowed in download routes
- **Existing infrastructure** — runner, CRM tools, ask_user_question, write_file, approval gate — all shipped
- **Browser APIs** — `getUserMedia`, `MediaRecorder`, `AnalyserNode` — standard, no polyfills needed for target browsers

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tab closed during recording → audio lost | Medium | Medium | Accept for v1. Add IndexedDB persistence in v2. |
| Groq rate limits at scale | Low | Medium | Fall back to AssemblyAI batch ($0.15/hr) |
| Agent can't infer speakers without diarization | Medium | Low | Bolt on AssemblyAI diarization if needed. Low effort. |
| iOS Safari suspends mic in background | Medium | Medium | "Keep Sunder open" warning. PWA silent audio hack later. |
| MediaRecorder format varies by browser | Low | Low | Runtime detection via `isTypeSupported()`. Groq accepts both WebM and MP4. |
| Presigned URL expires before upload completes | Low | Low | 1-hour expiry. Refresh if needed. |

## Scope Boundaries (from origin)

- No getDisplayMedia / tab audio capture (v2)
- No Chrome extension (v2)
- No desktop app (white-label Meetily if needed)
- No real-time streaming transcription
- No live transcript panel during recording
- No calendar integration
- No diarization (agent infers from context)
- No IndexedDB crash recovery
- No video recording
- No audio playback

## Future Considerations

- **v2: Tab audio capture** — `getDisplayMedia` for headphone + browser meeting case. Adds picker dialog UX.
- **v2: Chrome extension** — removes picker dialog. `tabCapture` API = one click.
- **v3: Desktop app** — white-label Meetily (MIT, Tauri) for system audio capture. Covers phone calls + native Zoom/Teams.
- **v3: Diarization** — AssemblyAI batch ($0.15/hr) or pyannote.audio self-hosted for speaker labels.
- **v4: Real-time streaming** — WebSocket to AssemblyAI/Deepgram for live transcript panel.
- **v4: Calendar integration** — auto-detect meetings, pre-pull CRM context.
